# Mermaid Food Truck

A cozy underwater cooking management game built in Godot 4.6. Dive for ingredients in waters that shift from cute to spooky, then run your food truck serving ocean-themed dishes.

## Game Loop

Each in-game day cycles through 6 phases:

**Dive Planning** → **Dive** → **Truck Planning** → **Truck** → **Results** → **Store**

- **Dive** — Swim through underwater environments gathering ingredients. Shallow waters are bright and friendly; deeper waters are darker and stranger, but hold rarer ingredients.
- **Truck** — Run your food truck. Customers order from your menu and you prepare dishes by working through stations (Prep, Cook, Plate).
- **Store** — Spend earnings on upgrades between days.

## Running

Open the project in Godot 4.6 and run the main scene.

## Status

Early development — working toward a polished vertical slice demo. See `game-design-doc.md` for full MVP scope.
